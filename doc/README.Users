How to Usertags a Bug at Report Time
====================================

If you're filing a bug and you what to usertag it, you can add these
lines (in the pseudo-header)

User: <user email address>
Usertags: <tag>

right after

Package: <package>
Version: <version>
Severity: <severity>

lines in the bug body.

Please note that if you specify more than 2 tag, then they will be
ordered alphabetically (so if you use usercategories, it will only
appears in the first one).

How to Use New GTK+ User Interface
==================================

If you tried to set the new GTK+ UI (named in reportbug as gtk2 ui)
and it fails to start (falling back to text mode, hopefully), chances
are that you are missing some of the needed modules:

 - python-gtk2
 - python-vte

If after installing both of them still GTK+ UI doesn't show up, please
file a report (in text ui :) ).

How to Use `gnus` MUA effectively
=================================

reportbug is now able to use an already running instance of emacs,
instead of spawning a new one.

In order to obtain that, you have to install:

- `emacs22-bin-common` or `emacs23-bin-common` (as mentioned in
  Suggests control field)

that contains the `emacsclient` program needed for the integration to
work (minimum version is 22 because earlier versions of `emacsclient`
did not support the `--eval` option).

Then a change to ~/.emacs file is needed, in order to add:

  (server-start)

or else Emacs won't listen for connections from emacsclient (and a new
`emacs` instance is executed).

With this changes, using the `gnus` MUA, the mail is opened in the
running `emacs`, or if there's none, a new instance is executed.
